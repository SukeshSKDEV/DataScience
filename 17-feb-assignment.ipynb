    "Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use\n",
    "MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "Ans :\n",
    "    MongoDB is  an open source Document-oriented database management system. It is designed for the storage\n",
    "    of large amount of data. It helps us to  work very efficiently with the data.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Non-relational database is a kind of a database that does not use tables, rows and columns to store data\n",
    "    as found in relational databases. Instead, non-relational databases use storage model that is optimized \n",
    "    for specific requirement of the type of data being stored. \n",
    "    ex. data may be stored as key-value pairs as in JSON documents or graph consists of edges and vertices.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    scenarios where it is preferred to use MongoDB over SQL databases :\n",
    "        1. When developers rapidly change their dataset without maintaining specific data model.\n",
    "        2. For rapid data growth and scalability required\n",

    "Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "Ans :\n",
    "    1. Schema less database : meaning same collection can hold different type of documents. It is not \n",
    "       necessary one document is similar to another document as in relational databases\n",
    "        \n",
    "    2. Document Oriented : Data is stored in documents as key-value pairs instead of column and rows \n",
    "                           as in relational databases. Key-value pair makes data very flexible to use.\n",
    "                           Each document has unique id.\n",
    "            \n",
    "    3. Index : Every field in the document is indexed with primary and secondary indices which make\n",
    "               it easier to get or search data from the data pool.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    4. Scalability : Mongodb provides horizontal scalability. It uses Sharding for this. \n",
    "            Sharding means the process of splitting larger datasets across multiple distributed collection.\n",
    "            This helps the database distribution and better execution which might otherwise be problematic\n",
    "            and lead to cumbersome queries.\n",
    "            \n",
    "    5. Replication : Mongodb creates multiple copies and send it to the server, so that if one server is \n",
    "                     failed, the data is retrieved from the other server.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    6. Aggregation : It allows you to perform operation on grouped data and get single result or computed \n",
    "                     result.\n",
    "                     It provides three different aggregations i.e, aggregation pipeline, map-reduce function, \n",
    "                     and single-purpose aggregation methods\n",
    "    \n",
    "    7. High Performance : The performance of MongoDB is very high and data persistance as compared to \n",
    "                          other databases due to its feature like scalability, indexing, replication etc."
